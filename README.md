## Install
Use the following commands to download and compile the package. Change `catkin_ws` depending on your setup.

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/Moraisgit/turtlebot_mcl_localization.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```
## Datasets
Several datasets were recorded and are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13gN8WpE1l5GEju-yHzZDzt4QcmkR-ijJ?usp=sharing).

## Important Tools

### Setting up the Gazebo Environment

- **Install Dependant ROS Packages**

What is explained next is more detailed documented [here](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/).

$ sudo apt install ros-noetic-turtlebot3-msgs
$ sudo apt install ros-noetic-turtlebot3
```

- **How to use**

Use the following commands to download and compile the package of turtlebot Gazebo environments. Change `catkin_ws` depending on your setup. Change `<distro>` depending on your ROS distribution.
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone -b <distro>-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```

Before launching anything, make sure to have a `roscore` running.

To launch Gazebo worls use the following commands. Change `catkin_ws` depending on your setup. Change `<launch_file_name>` depending on the world you intend to launch.
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo <launch_file_name>.launch
```

To teleoperate the turtlebot use the following commands. Change `catkin_ws` depending on your setup.
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
```

To launch the Rviz configuration use the following commands. Change `catkin_ws` depending on your setup.
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch
```

### Gmapping
Information about the package is more detailed documented [here](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping).

- **Install**

Use the following commands to download and compile the package. Change `catkin_ws` depending on your setup.
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```
- **How to use**

It is considered that the Gazebo environments mentioned earlier are set up.

Before launching anything, make sure to have a `roscore` running.

Launch the Rviz configuration as mentioned earlier and run the gmapping node with the topic of the LiDAR scans as an argument.
```
$ cd
$ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=/scan
```

To visualize the map on Rviz, click on "Add"->"By topic"->"Map"->"OK" and then "Global Options"->"Fixed Frame"->"map". An image follows in order to help the change process.

![rviz_change](https://github.com/Moraisgit/turtlebot_mcl_localization/assets/114250545/e212436c-4587-484b-80f7-955afc0c7e7d)

Then save the Rviz configuration with "File"->"Save Config As" and overwrite the file `turtlebot3_gazebo_model.rviz`.

To start seeing a map being built, play a dataset with the following command. Change `datasets` and `<rosbag_file_name>` according to where you have the datasets stored and the name of the file you intend to play. The flag `-r 3` will increase the speed that the rosbag is played.
```
$ cd ~/datasets
$ rosbag play <rosbag_file_name>.bag -r 3
```
